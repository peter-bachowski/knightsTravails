This is one of the projects in The Odin Project's curriculum that focuses on the use of data structures and algorithms and will be using the console to output the data. 

The project is based on the knight piece in chess which can move two spaces vertically and one space horizontally. The goal of the algorithm is to be able to calculate the lowest possible amount of moves to reach a specific location on an 8x8 chess board.
